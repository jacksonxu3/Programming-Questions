# Reverse Words In String

'''
Given a string, reverse the order of the words in the string. 
'''

# Runtime of O(n)
# Idea is to iterate through the string in reverse, keeping
# track of the end index of the word as you go towards the start
# of the string. When encountering a space, add the word to the
# array and add a space in front of it. Must also account
# for the end case outside of the iterative loop. 
def reverseWordsInString(string):
    length = len(string)
    end_indx = length
    toReturn = []

    # Iterate string in reverse
    for start_indx in range(length-1, -1, -1):
        # If there is a space, add the word from indx to indx
        if string[start_indx] == " ":
            toReturn.append(string[start_indx+1 : end_indx])
            toReturn.append(" ")
            end_indx = start_indx
    # Tail case for final word to add to array
    toReturn.append(string[0 : end_indx])
    
    return "".join(toReturn)
