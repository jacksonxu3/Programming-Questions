# Next Greater Element

'''
Given an array of integers, return a new array of integers, such that 
at every index of the new array, contains the next greater element in 
the original array at the same index. Treat arrays as circular. If an 
element is greatest, mark it as -1.

        indx = num % len(array)

        # Use the current index and compare it to the previous
        # indices that are in the stack, as those that are still
        # in the stack have not yet seen their next greatest element. 
        # We can stop going through the stack once we find an element that
        # is greater than our current element, as the elements further back
        # must be larger, as they too are still in the stack.
