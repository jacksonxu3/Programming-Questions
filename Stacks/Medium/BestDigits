# Best Digits

'''
Given a string representing a number and the number of digits to remove,
return a new string representing the largest possible number after
removing the number of digits specified.

# Runtime of O(n)
# To make the largest number, we want to push the largest number to the 
# most significant digit location. After doing this, we want to do the 
# same to any digits that follow. 
def bestDigits(number, numDigits):
    stack = []

    # Iterate through every digit
    for digit in number:
        # We want to push any higher digits to as high as possble in the stack
        while numDigits > 0 and stack and digit > stack[-1]:
            stack.pop()
            numDigits -= 1
        # Always append 
        stack.append(digit)

    # If we iterate through everything and there are still digits to remove,
    # remove last digits, as the the greatest digits are at the front already
    while numDigits > 0:

        numDigits -= 1

    # Use join function to turn array into string
