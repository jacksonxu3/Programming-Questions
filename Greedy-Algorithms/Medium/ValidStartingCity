# Valid Starting City

'''
Given an array of distances from one city to the next, the amount of
fuel in one city, and the miles per gallon your car can travel, return
the starting city that will allow you to run a loop through all of the
cities. The amount of gas will allow you to end the loop with 0 fuel left.

    additional_dist = []
    for indx in range(num_cities):
        additional_dist.append(fuel[indx] * mpg)

    # Starting city 0 with 0 fuel, and allowing your fuel to go negative after traveling, 
    # traverse through each city and keep track of the fuel you enter each city with.
    # The city with the lowest fuel will be the solution, because you will end the loop
    # with 0 fuel.
