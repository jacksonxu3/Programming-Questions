# Minimum Waiting Time
 
 '''
 Given an array of integers that represent the length of a task, compute the minimum
 waiting time. That is, the sum that every task must wait before it can start being done.
 '''
 
 # Time of O(n log n)
 # Greedy solution of doing the shortest tasks first

    queries.sort()
    for item in queries:
        sum_time += prev_time
