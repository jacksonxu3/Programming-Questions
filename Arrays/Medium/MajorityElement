# Majority Element

'''
Given an unsorted array, without sorting and only using O(1) space,
return the element in the array that makes up over half the array.
Assume all input arrays have a majority.

# Runtime of O(n)
def majorityElement(array):
    toReturn = 0
    count = 0

    # Keep track of a number as a solution, and increase its
    # count when seeing it, and decrease it when seeing something
    # else. At the end, the majority number will have be the one with
    # at least a count of 1 and marked as the solution. 
    for num in array:
        if count == 0:
            toReturn = num
